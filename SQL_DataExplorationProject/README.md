# SQL Data Exploration Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates basic SQL data exploration techniques. Using a traffic incident dataset, I explored:
- Total incidents
- Most common issues
- Hotspots by location
- Trends over time

## Skills Demonstrated
- SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY
- Aggregation functions (COUNT, MIN, MAX)
- Filtering and ordering data
- Data-driven insights

## How to Run
1. Load sample data: `SampleData.sql`
2. Run queries: `ExampleQueries.sql`
3. Analyze outputs and visualize results
